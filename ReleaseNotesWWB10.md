# Release Notes for wicketwebbeans-1.0 #

Wicket Web Beans 1.0 (final) has been released. Wicket Web Beans (WWB) is an Apache Wicket component toolkit for displaying and editing POJOs that conform to the JavaBeans specification. Web pages are automatically generated based on bean properties and certain conventions. If necessary, the layout, editability, and actions of these pages can be customized on an exception basis. In other words, the toolkit normally does what you'd expect, but when it doesn't, you can override its behavior.

Major inclusions in this release are the finalization of the Databinder integration and Wicket 1.3.0 (final) support.
