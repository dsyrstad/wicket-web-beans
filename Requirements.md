WWB currently requires:

  * Maven 2.0.x is required to build. A binary WAR file (wicketwebbeans-examples.war) containing all of the dependent jars is available.
  * Wicket 1.3.5 (http://wicket.apache.org) - dependency managed by Maven.
  * Apache Commons BeanUtils (via Maven http://maven.apache.org)
  * Java 5+. WWB has been developed and tested mostly with Java 6.
