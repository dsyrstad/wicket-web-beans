v2.0
----

- Elements are explicitly called out - no auto-derivation of elements from bean. However, can auto-derive label.
- If we want pre-built components, then where do actions reside? ThreadLocal context that has component, AjaxRequestTarget, bean. 
  Then we can call on any bean. Action method can return a List of ValidationMessages or IValidationError / ValidationError.
  What about info/warn messages? 
- ValidationMessage can have property name/expression - then message will be associated with that property.
- Support attachment of IValidator to fields. Support construction in here.
- Components are really beans .... So we could construct an IValidator above. Then it's starting to look a little spring-like.

- Only generic parameter is "class" or "component". 
- No automatic nesting of bean forms....
- How do dynamic values trigger? Do we evaluate each time? 
- How are beanprops found? Can be optionally explicit (InputStream/Reader or URL). 
- parameters are properties on beans?
- Don't sumbit entire form. Have a form with one hidden field that gets submitted back to Wicket. This 
would give knowledge of exactly what changed. How do we submit the entire thing on save - or do we?

- Use new Wicket-stuff data grid (http://wicketstuff.org/grid-examples/data-grid/simple.2)
- TinyMCE support at wicket-stuff: wicket-contrib-tinymce

- Component Composition

- ComponentRegistry can register one of these pre-configured components.
- How does initial matching of component name work? Passed to BeanMetaData as option, otherwise based on the 
bean class? Since implicit nesting of beans is no longer supported, it could just be called out in the constructor or
default to the "ROOT" component. 

- Distinguish parameter values as literals ("xyz", 5, 5.5) or symbols (prop/path/expr). Symbols are those that are
  not literals. 

- Automagic property change support via Ener-J derived agent. (Later)
