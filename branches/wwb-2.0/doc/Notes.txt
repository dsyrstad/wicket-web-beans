v2.0
----
- System config that is loaded first with BeanFactory - common defs
- Elements are explicitly called out - no auto-derivation of elements from bean. However, can auto-derive label.
- If we want pre-built components, then where do actions reside? ThreadLocal context that has component, AjaxRequestTarget, bean. 
  Then we can call on any bean. Action method can return a List of ValidationMessages or IValidationError / ValidationError.
  What about info/warn messages? 
- ValidationMessage can have property name/expression - then message will be associated with that property.
- Support attachment of IValidator to fields. Support construction in here.
- Components are really beans .... So we could construct an IValidator above. Then it's starting to look a little spring-like.
- PropertyResolver plugin. Default will be JXPath.

- Only generic parameter is "class" or "component". 
- No automatic nesting of bean forms....
- How do dynamic values trigger? Do we evaluate each time? 
- How is config found? Can be optionally explicit (InputStream/Reader or URL). 
- parameters are properties on beans?

- Use new Wicket-stuff data grid (http://wicketstuff.org/grid-examples/data-grid/simple.2)
- TinyMCE support at wicket-stuff: wicket-contrib-tinymce
- Wicket ExtJS support (beginnings) at http://www.wickettools.org

- Component Composition

- ComponentRegistry can register one of these pre-configured components.
- How does initial matching of component name work? Passed to BeanConfig as option, otherwise based on the 
bean class? Since implicit nesting of beans is no longer supported, it could just be called out in the constructor or
default to the "ROOT" component. 

- Distinguish parameter values as literals ("xyz", 5, 5.5) or symbols (prop/path/expr). Symbols are those that are
  not literals. 

- Automagic property change support via Ener-J derived agent. (Later) 


Component0 {
	class: TabbedLayout; # or component: for a pre-defined component - inherits those parameters and extends them.
	components: Component1 { label: "First Tab" }, Component4 { label: "Second Tab", displayed: someBooleanProp };
----> Shouldn't you be able to have a combination of properties and components? Properties could be literal strings
and components values
}

Component1 {
	class: BeanForm;
	layout: BeanGridPanel;
	elements: 
		"prop1/prop2" { params }, 
		"prop3/collection" { component: Component2, override-props-for-component: x },
		"prop3/collection" { class: ComponentClass, properties... },
		prop5 { label : ${prop6/prop7} };  # Dynamic values    
}

Component2 { # Table
	class: BeanTable;
	rowComponent: Component3;
	- or -
	rowElements: "prop3", "prop4";
}

Component3 { # Row
	class: BeanTableRow;
	elements: "prop3", "prop4";
}

Component4 {
	class: BeanForm;
	elements: 
		"prop1/prop2" { params }; 
}
